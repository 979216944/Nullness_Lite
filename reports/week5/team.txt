Week 3 Team Report
Team: Nullness_Lite


* Previous Week’s Plans and Goals
   * Finish disabling the first feature together by 4/23.
   * Each member should start implementing the assigned feature in his/her own branch. Here are some suggestions:
      * Focus on disabling feature first.
      * Accumulate the disabled annotations. Better record them in personal status report so we don’t forget.
      * Accumulate and the specification tests (short test cases). Here are some examples, see nullness related directories.
      * More refer to the implementation procedure in presentation slides.
   * Consider more balance comparison between Nullness_Lite and various nullness checkers (such as NullAway, FindBugs, etc.), in aspect of true positives and false positives they produce. 
* This Week’s Progress
   * Finished the following features:
      * Assuming all values are initialized
         * Uses “-AsuppressWarnings=uninitialized” 
      * Assuming Map.get(key), key is always in Map
      * Assuming all methods are side-effect-free, and no aliasing is allowed 
         * Uses “-AassumeSideEffectFree”
         * Overrides canAlias in NullnessStore.java
   * Finished implementing the command line option:
      * See commit https://github.com/979216944/checker-framework/commit/dd17f6d6d0f7ccadb189ef63c8b03288506a488a
   * Test examples added for Nullness_Lite:
      * See commit https://github.com/979216944/checker-framework/commit/fbc6087f512451a3471d2a20847497756c564413
   * Successfully built through Travis CI
   * Begin the evaluation of other tools
      * Successfully built FindBugs on local machines and applied it to our initial test files 
      * Analyzed the results shown by FindBugs
      * Chose several open-source projects that will be used by our evaluation of the tools
* Next Week’s Plans and Goals
   * Finish feature: Assuming boxing of primitives always return same objects
   * Finish tests added for Nullness_Lite
   * Choose one open-source program to focus on
   * Finish the evaluation of FindBugs
