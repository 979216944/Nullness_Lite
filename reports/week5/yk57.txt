2. This Week’s Progress

	• Finished disbling map key checker and it passed my simple test
		-AsuppressedWarnins=keyfor
		- Test file (local): KeyforExample.java
	• Still working on boxing of primitives in figuring out how annotated JDK works
		- make all wrapper classes' valueOf() method pure+ recompile
		- possible approach: replace @sideEffectFree with @pure
	• Start working on adding annotations to my cse331 project's .java files.

	Challenges:
		* Figure out a test case for boxing of primitives
		* annotate cse331's project files correctly

3. Next Week’s Plans and Goals
	• Finish implementation of boxing of primitives
	• Finish add two features to -ANullnessLite option to finish our project's implementation part
	• Finish annotations on cse331 project
	• Start working on adding annotations on other projects and test with our finished implementation
	• Begin evaluating other checkers
