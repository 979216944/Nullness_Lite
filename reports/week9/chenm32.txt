1. My goal from a week ago:	
	- evaluate NullAway
	- improve the manual (script) of reproducing our evaluation result
	- revise the user manual by including the data we've got during the evaluation
2. My process this week:
	- prepare for the first draft presentation and make slides
	- revise the user manual by including the data we've got during the evaluation
	- evaluate IntelliJ by following the revised plan:
	  since it has a functionality called "Infer Nullity" which automatically 
	  infers null-related annotations to a project, we decide to evaluate IntelliJ
	  in the following two ways: 
	  1. evaluate on the "no-annotations" version of JUnit4  
	  2. first use "Infer Nullity" to add annotations to JUnit4, and then evaluate on this "annotations-added" version
	  80% done
3. My plan for the following week:
	- finish evaluating IntelliJ
	- revise the user manual (or script files) for reproducing our evaluating results
