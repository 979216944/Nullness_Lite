NetID: chenm32
Student Number: 1532296

1. My goal from a week ago:	
	- finish evaluating IntelliJ
	- revise the user manual (or script files) for reproducing our evaluating results
	- revise the user manual by including the data we've got during the evaluation
2. My process this week:
	- finish evaluating IntelliJ (with annotations added by Infer Nullity):
		- classify every true/false positive and write comments about the analysis
		- try to add annotations to eliminate at least some of the errors
	- peer review with other team members
	- have a meeting with Alice (Xinrong) Zhao in order to double check that each classification is reasonable
	- revise the project report and user manual:
		- add new data  
		- reason out IntelliJ's results
3. My plan for the following week:
	- check that every classification of errors of the intellij2 version is correct
	- revise the reproduction manual for IntelliJ and Eclipse
	- reason out the evaluation results
