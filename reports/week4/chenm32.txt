1. My goal from a week ago:
	- configure Checker Framework on Eclipse
	- understand the source code of Nullness Checker, Checker Framework
	- discuss with other team members about implementation plans
2. My process this week:
	- configure Checker Framework
	- distribute roles in team: 
		my job at the implementation stage is to disable the "initialization analysis" feature of Nullness Checker
	- read and understand the source code of Nullness Checker, Checker Framework
	- make architecture and implementation plan with other team members
	- have trouble fully understanding the source code of Checker Framework
3. My plan for the following week:
	- continue reading and understanding the souce code of Checker Framework
	- start implementation: 
		team members disable one feature of Nullness Checker together
		and then I will start focusing on "initialization analysis"
