1. Previous Week’s Plans and Goals
	• Finish implementation of boxing of primitives
	• Finish add two features to -ANullnessLite option to finish our project's implementation part
	• Finish annotations on cse331 project
	• Start working on adding annotations on other projects and test with our finished implementation
	• Begin evaluating other checkers

2. This Week’s Progress
	• Revised proposal and user manual in README
	• Found the mapkey feature was not implemented correctly last week, and fixed it.
		- not as simple as just -AsuppressedWarnins=keyfor, need some code changes
		- edited NullnessTransfer.java to assume Map.get(key) always return nonnull
	• Added new test cases in Test file (local): KeyforExample.java for test mapkey feature
	• Finished boxing of primitives 
		- figured out how annotated JDK works
			- tried to change the .valueOf methods' annotations in NullnessTransfer and NullnessAnnotatedTypeFactory when method is invocated, but both do not seem to work.
			- then found an alternative way -- stub file
		- figured out how .astub files works and added a nullness_lite.astub:
			- make all wrapper classes' valueOf() method @pure
			- added Astubs = <path to nullness_lite.astub> to NullnessLite option
	• Figured out test cases for boxing of primitives with Martin's help
		- Test file (local): BoxingExample.java for test boxing feature
	• The NullnessLite option was not added to the Nullness Checker correctly last week, and fixed it
		- need to call super.init() after to make all options added in the Nullness Checker work
	• Finished adding two features to -ANullnessLite option

	Challenges:
		* Realized -AsuppressedWarnins=keyfor does not do the thing I wanted, so I reimplemented the first feature.
		* Realized NullnessLite option was not implemented correctly and fixed it. 
		* The boxing of primitives was really hard to understand and implement. It took me over a week to figure out by trying to make changes in NullnessTransfer and NullnessAnnotatedTypeFactory first and then trying to work with stub files. 
		* Since I found several things were not finished correctly, it took me some time to fix them and I was unable to finish testing cse331's project yet. It still confused me by warning about checkRep() method and I will figure it out the following week.

3. Next Week’s Plans and Goals
	• Write some unit tests for my two features and add them to /tests folder
	• Merge my implementation with Alice's
	• Write more unit tests for NullnessLite option and test its overall correctness
	• Finish testing Nullness Checker and our NullnessLite option on cse331 project
	• Do some basic analysis on performance of Nullness Checker and our NullnessLite option on cse331 project and cse332 project if time allows
