Name: zhaox29


* Previous Week’s Plans and Goal (4/23 - 4/30)
   * Finished writing the true positives cases in the tests suite
   * Finding false positives test cases for these features
   * Collecting annotations for features disabled
   * Finished the whole implementation by merging the works with Anny
   * Study CF papers: how professor got his comparaison result? What methodology did he used?
   * Begin Evaluating other checkers
* This Week’s Progress
   * Finished specification tests of true positives for (1) assuming all values initialized and (2) assuming no aliasing and all methods @SideEffectFree
   * Finished false positives for (2) above
   * Assigned the pull request to Anny for all changes made in zhaox29-init-inva
   * Helped Anny with adding “-AsuppressWarnings=keyfor” into KeyForSubChecker when “-ANullnessLite” is passed, and studied the possible change places for boxing of primitives. (She has finished her features being disabled now.)
* Next Week’s Plans and Goals (4/30 - 5/7)
   * Find false positives test cases for Initialization Checker if not assuming all values initialized
   * Merging works with Anny to give a complete version of NullnessLite
   * Extra command line arguments that distinguish the features of NullnessLite for evaluation
   * Revise the section of approach in report
   * Join the evaluation team with Anny, to start adding annotations and evaluate Nullness Checker and NullnessLite
