Week 6 Team Report
Team: NullnessLiteGroup


* Previous Week's Plans and Goals
   * Finish feature: Assuming boxing of primitives always return same objects
   * Finish tests added for Nullness_Lite
   * Choose one open-source program to focus on
   * Finish the evaluation of FindBugs
* This Week's Progress
   * Revised motivation, related work, approach, and some evaluation parts of the proposal and added some examples to the user manual in README
   * Finished adding four features to -ANullnessLite option and merged our initial four implementations(mapkey, dataflow, aliasing, boxing):
   * Revised implementations:
      * SubCheckers have the same options as Nullness Checker
      * Store & Analysis are revised in KeyForSubChecker so it disallows aliasing
   * Fixed the Mapkey feature
      * not as simple as just -AsuppressedWarnins=keyfor, need modifications to NullnessTransfer.java by letting it assume Map.get(key) always return nonnull
      * Added new test cases in Test file (local): KeyforExample.java for test Mapkey feature
   * Implemented boxing of primitives 
      * Figured out how annotated Jdk and .astub files works
      * Making all wrapper classes' valueOf() method @pure
      * Using Astubs = <path to nullness_lite.astub> to NullnessLite option
      * Added test cases for boxing of primitives with Martin's help
      * Added extra test cases for ensuring it works with its sub checker, MapKey Checker
      * Test file (local): BoxingExample.java for test boxing feature
   * Fixed the NullnessLite option 
      * Call super.init() after all options being added to add its options iteratively into sub checker if any.
   * Chose an open-source Java project, junit4, for evaluation: https://github.com/junit-team/junit4, and built junit4 on local machine
   * Began evaluating Eclipse, IntelliJ and Nullness Checker by using junit4
* Next Week's Plans and Goals
   * Finish adding annotations for junit4
      * Adding annotations for different checkers in separate branches
      * Assigning annotations review by Monday 5/7
   * Decide our rules of adding annotations and make sure it is conforming
   * Do some basic analysis on performance of Nullness Checker and our NullnessLite option on junit4
   * Finish evaluating Eclipse, IntelliJ and FindBugs
