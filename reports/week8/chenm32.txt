1. My goal from a week ago:	
	- finish evaluating Nullaway on JUnit4
	- peer review with the Implementation Group (Xinrong and Yanmeng)
	- continuously revise the project report
	- revise the user manual by including the data we've got during the evaluation
2. My process this week:
	- peer review with the Implementation Group (Xinrong and Yanmeng)
	- improve the "related works" and "evaluation" parts of the project report
	- revise the plan for evaluating IntelliJ: since it has a functionality called "Infer Nullity"
	  which automatically infers null-related annotations to a project, we decide to evaluate IntelliJ
	  in the following two ways: 
	  1. evaluate on the "no-annotations" version of JUnit4  
	  2. first use "Infer Nullity" to add annotations to JUnit4, and then evaluate on this "annotations-added" version
	- work with Yuqi:
		- evaluate NullAway (half done)
		- re-evaluate IntelliJ by following our revised plan
		- classify and write the analysis of each null-related error appeared during the evaluation of Eclipse, IntelliJ and FindBugs
3. My plan for the following week:
	- finish evaluating NullAway
	- improve the manual (script) of reproducing our evaluation result
