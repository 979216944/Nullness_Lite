* Previous Week’s Plans and Goal (5/7 - 5/14)
   * [!!!] A bug was found in NullnessLite, planning to fix the bug with Anny before ⅝
      * See the issue tracker for more info
      * *Adding test for the bug
   * [!!!] -Astubs doesn’t work properly with multiple stub files. Discuss the problem with other group members before 5/8
      * This problem is crucial for later writing script for evaluation, because write now we are using Intellij for analysis due to easier navigation between files and libraries;
   * Command line arguments should be more specified for invalidation of dataflow and keyfor features
   * Seek more evidences from JUnit, and research papers if time allows, to enhance the report, and write about how we determine an error true/false positive
   * After finishing the bug fix and analysis for the Nullness Checker, record the result of each feature with group members (if other members finished analyzing other checkers)
      * This work should be relative easier if we finished analyzing with the Nullness Checker
   * With group members, writing script for users to easily count the @Nullable annotations to use the Nullness Checker properly
* This Week’s Progress
   * Bug fixed
   * Specific command line arguments values added
   * Real world examples found in JUnit4, except aliasing
   * Report enhanced for evaluation steps
   * -ANullnessLite re-annotated with comments about why we annotate like that
   * Script written for evaluation steps
* Next Week’s Plans and Goals (5/14 - 5/21)
   * Prepare presentation slides
   * Synchronize the evaluation result in Intellij and in command line
   * Finish the -ANullnessLite annotation and evaluation
   * Enhance the script for evaluation
