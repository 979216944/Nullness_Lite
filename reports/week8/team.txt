Week 8 Team Report
Team: NullnessLiteGroup

-	Previous Week’s Plans and Goals
  -	Review proposal and user manual
  -	Analyze the remaining warnings manually, figuring out true and false warnings
  -	Found a new project to analyze

-	This Week’s Progress
  -	Revised proposal and user manual in README
    -	Revised introduction, related works, hypothesis, experimentation and progress part
  -	Presentation preparation
    -	Making slides
    -	Summarize current progress
  -	Analyze the remaining 50 warnings manually, figuring out true and false warnings
    -	the initial analysis shows 64 false warnings and 64 true warnings
  -	Progress for analyzing NullnessLite
    -	Reduced 120+ warnings by stub files, adding annotations and analysis
    -	Additional annotations for reducing false positives despite @Nullable:
      -	@UnderInitialization
      -	@UnknownInitialization
    -	Analysis comments added for annotations in branch annos_nl_all_xz, we plan to compare it with the branch annotate the Nullness Checker for peer review
  -	Progress for analysing the Nullness Checker:
    -	Finished the initial result but needs peer review with Nullness_Lite branch to fix the places where we added annotations and did analysis incorrectly
  -	Bug is fixed in NullnessLite, peer review needed
  - Finish evaluating Eclipse, FindBugs, and version1 of IntelliJ
  - Evaluate NullAway and version2 of IntelliJ (Infer Nullity) [in progress]

	- Challenges: 
    -	Some analysis on true/false positives are incorrect for the initial result, so we have to review those analysis to ensure the final results will be correct. Therefore, we adjusted our plan from finding a new project to focusing more on the current one, junit4, since we underestimated the work required for adding annotations and analysis.
    - It takes us a while installing NullAway and running JUnit4 on it. 

-	Next Week’s Plans and Goals
  -	Review proposal and user manual
  -	Fix the incorrect analysis of the Nullness Checker
  -	Finish the remaining analysis of NullnessLite
  -	Start the analysis of individual features for NullnessLite if time allows
  - Finish the peer review of the analysis of Eclipse, FindBugs and IntelliJ (version1)
  - Finish evaluating IntelliJ (version2)
  - Continually work on NullAway
  - Revise the script files (or manuals) of reproducing our evaluation results
